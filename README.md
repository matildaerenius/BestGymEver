The purpose of the program is to help the receptionist at "Best Gym Ever" check the membership status of individuals by searching a file containing customer data (names, personal numbers, and last payment date). 
Based on the search, the program categorizes the person as either:

A current member (paid membership within the last year),
A former member (paid more than a year ago),
Or not a member (person not found in the file).

Additionally, the program should log visits of paying members (name, personal number, and visit date) in a separate file for the personal trainer to track client workout frequency.
